# Quiz Manager App

This project is my CodeNation apprenticeship submission. It's a quiz manager which includes three role based permissions to play; "admin" to create and edit quizzes, "user" to see questions and answers - essentially the ability to play the game, and "non-user" who can only view quizzes and questions, not answers.
